# slmrf

This repository contains the code used for the simulation study in the manuscript "Comparing Spatial Regression to Random Forests for Large Environmental Data Sets."  The repository is set up as an R package that contains functions that can simulate geostatistical data, estimate spatial regression models, and make kriging predictions.  The simulation code (R Markdown file) and data are located in the `\inst` folder of the package directory.

To install:

* using the `devtools` package: `install_github("ericwfox/slmrf")`

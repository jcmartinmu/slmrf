# slmrf

This repository contains supplementary material for the manuscript "Comparing Spatial Regression to Random Forests for Large Environmental Data Sets."  The repository is set up as an R package that can be used to run the simulations discussed in Section 6 of the manuscript.  The repository also contains a supplementary PDF with (1) a step-by-step description of the covariate selection procedure; (2) computation details of the random forest regression kriging computations; and (3) additional tables and figures.  The simualtion code (R markdown file) and supplmentary PDF are both located in the `\inst` folder.

To install:

* using the `devtools` package: `install_github("ericwfox/slmrf")`
